### 1. **Installing `yfinance` using PyCharm:**

#### Step 1: Open PyCharm
- Open your PyCharm IDE and select the project where you want to install the `yfinance` package.

#### Step 2: Open Settings/Preferences

#### Step 3: Install the Package
- In the left sidebar, navigate to `Project: <your_project_name>` -> `Python Interpreter`.
- Click on the `+` icon to add a new package.
- In the search bar that appears, type "yfinance" and press Enter.
- Select `yfinance` from the results, then click `Install Package`.

#### Step 4: Verify Installation
- After the installation is complete, you’ll see `yfinance` listed in your installed packages under the Python
Interpreter settings.

   ```


### Post Installation (Testing `yfinance`):
Once installed, you can use `yfinance` in your Python scripts. Here’s a quick test you can try:

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Fetch data for Apple stock (AAPL)
data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2022-01-01", end="2023-01-01")

# Display the data
print(data.head())
```
