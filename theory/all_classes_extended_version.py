## 1.1 - What is Object-oriented programming

    ### Definition/Concept:
        Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a design paradigm where the data structures are defined as objects that
        can possess their behavior (methods) and attributes.

    ### Why do we use OOP:
        Code structured according to OOP principles is easier to manage, test, and debug, given its organized and
        modular nature.
        OOP also allows us to encapsulate (i.e., 'hide') internal state and behavior of objects, exposing only what's
        required. This provides a clean and controllable interface with the object's data and functions.

    ### When to use OOP:
        OOP is excellent for situations where you need to create multiple instances that share common behavior but
        have unique states. It also allows programmers to build complex framework while maintaining readability and
        scalability. OOP also allows multiple developers to work easily at the same time in a common project.


## 1.2 - Fundamental Concepts in OOP

    The backbone of OOP includes these four fundamental concepts:
    1. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is all about safe data storage. It binds together code (methods) and the data
                          it manipulates (attributes), keeping both safe from outside interferences and misuse.

    2. **Inheritance:** Inheritance allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes,
                        reducing repetitive code.

    3. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows us to redefine methods for derived classes, which enables us to perform
                         a single action in different ways.

    4. **Abstraction:** Abstraction allows us to hide complex details and display only the essentials,
                        providing a simpler user interface.


## 1.3 - Benefits of OOP

    **Modularity for easier troubleshooting: When an issue pops up, you can typically spot it in the
                                             code block or 'object' in question. For example, in a complex
                                             trading algorithm, if a calculation error appears, you can likely
                                             isolate the problem to a specific stock object - which greatly
                                             simplifies the debugging process.

    **Reuse of code through inheritance:Inheritance allows classes to inherit characteristics from existing
                                        classes. Consequently, it helps in reducing code redundancy,
                                        particularly when creating intricate financial models with common
                                        components.

    **Flexibility through polymorphism: This is extremely useful when implementing complex systems that
                                        require a single interface to control different inputs.

    Through these advantages, the principles of OOP allow us to model and solve complex problems more robustly, 
    efficiently, and intuitively.

"""
## 1.4 - Classes and Objects in Python
    **Definition/Concept:** 
        In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template that defines the variables and 
        the methods (functions) common to all objects of a certain kind. An object is a specimen of a class.
    
    **Why:** 
        Using classes, we encapsulate data and the methods that operate on them so they are easy to reuse and maintain.
        Objects provide a simple way to access this data and methods provided by classes.
    
    **When to use it:** 
        Classes and objects are used when we need to group relevant data and methods into a single place.


## 1.5 - Attributes and Methods in Python
    **Definition/Concept:** 
        An attribute is a characteristic of an object. These are essentially variables that are bound to the 
        instances of the class. Methods, on the other hand, define the behaviors of these objects. These are 
        like functions defined within a class.

    **Why:** 
        Attributes and methods encapsulate the state and logic of the entities modelled into a cohesive unit.

    **When to use it:** 
        Attributes are used when we need information about the object that must endure for as long as the object exists.
         Methods are used when behavior or action needs to be defined for an object. 
         

## Summary / Key take-away ##   
    A Class in Python is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. It is a user-defined prototype that 
    consists of attributes and methods that act on those attributes. Attributes are the characteristics of the class, 
    while methods define the behaviors of the class.              
"""

"""
EXAMPLE : First example of a class in Python
"""


class FinancialAsset:
    def __init__(self, ticker):
        self.ticker = ticker

    def display_ticker(self):
        print(f'Ticker Symbol: {self.ticker}')


apple_equity = FinancialAsset('AAPL')
print(apple_equity.ticker) #'AAPL'
apple_equity.display_ticker()  # Ticker Symbol: AAPL

""" 
## 1.6 - The self Parameter

    **Definition/Concept:** 
        `self` is a parameter in the instance method and is a reference to the instance of the class. 
    
    **Why:** 
        The `self` represents the instance of the class and by using the `self` keyword we can access the attributes 
        and methods associated with the instance.
    
    **When to use it:** 
        `self` is also used as a parameter in instance methods notably in object initializers which are 
        established by the `__init__` method.


## 1.7 - The `__init__` Method

    **Definition/Concept**: 
        The `__init__` method is one of Python's special methods used for initializing the attributes of a class.
    
    **Why**: 
        The `__init__` method when declared in a class, is automatically invoked when the object of the class is 
        instantiated.
    
    **When to use it:** 
        `__init__` is handy when we need to initialize our object's attributes when the object is being created.


In the above example, we see that `self` is used as the first parameter of the `__init__` method as well as 
being used to define the `display_ticker()` method.
"""

"""
## 1.8 - Encapsulation in Python

    Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming. It involves bundling data
    (attributes) and the methods that manipulate them into a single unit (the class) and controlling access to this
    data from outside the class.

    **Definition/Concept: Public and Private attributes in Python:**
        Unlike languages like Java or C++, Python does not have a strict mechanism to define attributes or methods
        as "private" or "public." Instead, Python follows a naming convention to indicate the developer's intention
        regarding the usage of attributes and methods.

        *Public Attributes and Methods:**
          Named normally, without an underscore.
          Example: `self.attribute`, `def method(self):`
          These are considered part of the class's public interface.

        *"Private" Attributes and Methods (by convention):**
          Prefixed with a single underscore `_`.
          Example: `self._attribute`, `def _method(self):`
          This indicates that these elements are intended for internal use and should not be accessed directly from
          outside the class. This convention is based on trust; technically, these elements remain accessible.

        *Name Mangling for Attributes and Methods:**
          Prefixed with a double underscore `__` (without an underscore at the end).
          Example: `self.__attribute`, `def __method(self):`
          Python applies "name mangling", i.e. it automatically changes of the attribute / method to include the class
          name making access from outside more difficult but not impossible.

    **Why:**
        Encapsulation helps in controlling access to data, providing flexibility to modify the internal implementation
        without affecting the code that uses the class, preventing accidental modifications to internal data, and
        improving code clarity by distinguishing between the public interface and implementation details.

    **When to use it:**
        Use encapsulation when you want to protect the internal state of an object and ensure that only the intended
        methods or functions can modify it.
        Use public methods (getters/setters) to control access to internal data if needed.
        Follow naming conventions (`_attribute` for internal use, `__attribute` for name mangling) to clearly indicate
        the intended use of attributes and methods.

    **Important Points to Remember:**
        Encapsulation in Python is based on conventions rather than strict restrictions.
        Attributes and methods prefixed with a single underscore `_` are considered internal to the class.
        The double underscore `__` triggers name mangling, making external access more difficult but not impossible.
        Encapsulation is a matter of design and programming discipline in Python.

## 1.9 - Inheritance in Python

    ** Definition/Concept ** 
        Inheritance is a pillar of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class to inherit features 
        (methods and properties) from another class. The class being inherited from is known as the parent class, 
        superclass or base class, and the class that inherits is known as the child class, subclass or derived class.

    ** Why and When to Use Inheritance **
        Inheritance is primarily used to enhance code reusability. Instead of writing repetitive code, common 
        features can be defined in a base class, and other classes can inherit these features. Inheritance should
        be used when there's a clear hierarchical relationship among classes. 
         
    ** Additional Properties **
        An additional feature of inheritance is that a subclass could be considered as the parent class in the code.
        When checking for the type of a subclass, the subclass will return true when we test the following equality:
        isinstance(bond, FinancialAsset) with bond an instance of the Bond class. However, a parent class could not
        be considered as a subclass. This principle is the class hierarchy principle

        
"""

"""
EXAMPLE : In finance, we deal with different types of financial instruments such as bonds and stocks. 
          Each of these instruments can be modeled as a class, inheriting from a base class `FinancialAsset`.

'Bond` and `Stock` classes inherit from the `FinancialAsset` class and add additional attributes specific to each 
instrument. They also contain respective financial computation methods.

## Multiple Inheritance in Python

    **Definition/Concept:**
        Python supports multiple inheritance, which means that a class can inherit from multiple parent classes.
        This allows a derived class to combine functionalities from several base classes.

    ** Syntax of Multiple Inheritance:**
        Python uses a straightforward syntax to define multiple inheritance by listing all parent classes
        in the parentheses after the class name.

    **Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Detail**
        The Method Resolution Order (MRO) is crucial for understanding how Python handles inheritance, especially 
        multiple inheritance.

        The MRO defines the order in which Python searches for methods and attributes in a class hierarchy.

        This is particularly important in multiple inheritance scenarios where multiple parent classes may define 
        the same method.

        Python uses the C3 Linearization Algorithm to determine the MRO. This algorithm ensures that:
            - Subclasses appear before their parent classes.
            - The order of parent classes declared is preserved.
            - The MRO is monotonic (a class always appears before its parents).

        Understanding the MRO is crucial to:
            - Avoid name conflicts in multiple inheritance.
            - Understand the order in which methods are executed.
            - Design coherent and predictable class hierarchies.

# Visualizing MRO:
# You can visualize the MRO of a class using the mro() method or the __mro__ attribute:

## 1.10 - Polymorphism

    ** Definition/Concept **    
        Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
        In the context of programming, polymorphism allows us to use a single interface with different underlying forms. 
        This means that functions or classes can be used with many types of objects, and behave differently based on 
        the object's type.
        In simpler terms, polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms, and it allows the programmer 
        to treat derived class members just like their parent class's members. This increases code reusability and 
        improves the efficiency of the code.

    ** Why to use it** 
        Polymorphism brings two major benefits:
        1. __Flexibility__: It allows developers to use the same function/entity name to mean different things in 
                            different contexts, making the code more flexible and easy-to-understand.
        2. __Reusability__: Polymorphism encourages reusability by accommodating different types and classes in the
                            same entity, or function. This reduces unnecessary code and makes it more efficient.

    ** When to use it **
        Polymorphism is useful when you have a list (or other collections) of objects that could be instances of 
        several different classes related through inheritance and you want to operate on them in the same way. 
        It's heavily used in "abstract factory" design patterns and it stands as a pillar in larger software 
        modularization.

         Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic):
            Achieved through method overriding
            Resolved at runtime

        Compile-time Polymorphism (Static):
            Achieved through method overloading
            Resolved at compile time

Method Overriding
    Method overriding is a fundamental aspect of runtime polymorphism. It occurs when a derived class (child class) 
    has a method with the same name and signature as a method in its base class (parent class).

    Key Points about Method Overriding:
        Same Name and Signature: The overriding method must have the same name and parameter list as the method in 
        the parent class.

    Runtime Decision: The method to be invoked is determined at runtime based on the object’s type.

    Extends or Modifies Behavior: Overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method 
    that is already defined in its parent class.

    Polymorphic Behavior: It’s a key mechanism for achieving polymorphic behavior in OOP.

Method Overloading
    Method overloading is a fundamental aspect of compile-time polymorphism (static polymorphism). 
        It occurs when a class contains multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists 
        (different types, number of parameters, or both).

    Key Points about Method Overloading:
        Same Name, Different Signatures: The overloaded methods must share the same name but have different parameter 
        lists. This difference can be in the number of parameters, the types of parameters, or both.

    Compile-time Decision: The method to be invoked is determined at compile time based on the method signature 
    that matches the arguments provided during the method call.

    Enhances Flexibility: Overloading allows a class to perform similar or related operations with different inputs, 
    providing multiple ways to use the same method name. This enhances code readability and usability.

    Not Polymorphic at Runtime: Unlike method overriding, method overloading does not exhibit polymorphic behavior at
    runtime. All decisions are made during compilation, and no dynamic method dispatch occurs.

## 1.11 - Abstraction in Python

    ** Definition/Concept** 
        Abstraction in OOP is the process of hiding the underlying details and displaying only the functionalities. 
        It helps to reduce the complexity by separating the behavior from the implementation. 
        In Python, one way to perform abstraction is through using Abstract Base Classes (ABCs). 
        An Abstract Base Class is a class serving as a blueprint for other classes. 
        It allows you to define methods that must be created within any child classes built from the ABC. 
        Therefore, it provides a certain level of design structure, enforcing that certain methods exist within any 
        child classes.
        
    ** Why to use it** 
        Abstraction allows us to define a clear and consistent interface of an object in our code. 
        By leveraging the ABCs, we can ensure that all classes that derive from our abstract base class will adhere to 
        the same interface. This helps to improve the maintainability and readability of our code, as we can code 
        using the abstract base class knowing that certain methods will always be present in any subclasses.
        
        Moreover, code abstraction can allow better system design and efficient, scalable code. More subsequent 
        operations and functionalities can be added and integrated with minimal disruption to the original code 
        structure. 
        
    ** When to use it  ** 
        ABCs should be employed when we have a core set of methods that we expect to be present in every subclass, 
        but we do not want to provide a default implementation for those methods. 
        This is particularly relevant when we have a number of related classes with common functionalities 
        which need not be repeated in each individual class. 
        
    ** How to implement an abstract class**
        You will find below a basic implementation of an abstract method. The AbstractClassExample is an abstract 
        class as it implements/ inherit the ABC class.
        When the @abstractmethod is defined prior a function, this makes this function mandatory for every subclass 
        implementing the abstract class. When @abstractmethod is not defined prior a function, its implementation 
        become non-mandatory. It considers as best practice to only implement mandatory method in an abstract class.

# Protocol in Python

    **Protocols**, introduced in Python 3.8, provide a way to define structural subtyping (often called “duck typing”).
     They allow you to define interfaces in a more flexible and Pythonic way compared to abstract base classes as
     you get ride of the principle of hierarchy.

    ## Key Concepts
        - **Structural Subtyping**: An object is considered a subtype if it has the required methods and attributes, 
                                    regardless of inheritance.
        - **No Runtime Enforcement**: Protocols are primarily used for static type checking and don’t enforce method 
                                      implementation at runtime.
        - **Flexibility**: Classes don’t need to explicitly inherit from a Protocol to be considered compatible.

    To use Protocols, you need to import them from the `typing` module:
"""

from typing import Protocol, List

class Tradable(Protocol):
    symbol: str

    def current_price(self) -> float:
        ...

"""
`Tradable` is a protocol that specifies any object with a `symbol` attribute of type `str` and a `current_price` 
method that returns a `float`.
The ... is the ellipsis literal in Python. It serves as a placeholder indicating that the method current_price is 
intentionally left without an implementation. This is commonly used in abstract base classes, interfaces, or protocols 
to define methods that subclasses or implementing classes must override.
Now, consider a class `Stock` that doesn't inherit from `Tradable` but matches its structure.
We can write a function that accepts any object conforming to the `Tradable` protocol.
"""

class Ticker:
    def __init__(self, symbol: str):
        self.current_symbol = symbol
        self.old_symbol = []

class Stock:
    def __init__(self, symbol: str, price_per_share: float):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.price_per_share = price_per_share

    def current_price(self) -> float:
        return self.price_per_share

def display_instrument_price(instrument: Tradable): # the function only accepts input variable that match the Tradable "type"
    print(f"The current price of {instrument.symbol} is ${instrument.current_price():.2f}")

ticker = Ticker("AAPL")
stock = Stock("AAPL", 150.0)
display_instrument_price(stock)  # Output: The current price of AAPL is $150.00

"""
Even though `Stock` doesn't inherit from `Tradable`, it is accepted by the `display_instrument_price` function 
because it has the required `symbol` attribute and `current_price` method.

## 2.1 - PEP 8 : coding convention for Python code

Why do we used a coding convention ?
    - A consistent coding style is important for collaborative projects. When multiple developers work on the same
    codebase, varying styles can lead to confusion and decrease code maintainability. PEP 8 provides a foundation
    upon which developers can write code that is easily comprehensible by others.

Imports :
    - Always put imports at the top of the file.
    - Import standard libraries first, followed by third-party libraries, and then your own modules.
    - Standard libraries are the libraries that are included with Python, meaning when you install Python,
    these libraries are installed too. Example : math, datetime, json, ...
    - Third-party libraries are developed by individual developers or teams that are not affiliated with the
     official Python development team. Example: pandas, numpy, seaborn, sckit-learn, yfinance, ....
    - Tips : You can separate Built-in and third party libraries from your own module by a blank line

Naming convention:
    - Variables and function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores to improve
    readability. This style is known as "snake_case".
    - Constants are usually defined on a module/ class level and written in all capital letters with underscores
    separating words.
    - Class names should normally use the CapWords (also known as CamelCase) convention. Every word is capitalized
    and there are no underscores between words.
    - Like function names, method names and instance variables should be lowercase, with words separated by
    underscores to improve readability.

    Additional guidelines:
    - When naming variables, give them descriptive names so that individuals who didn't write the script can
    intuitively understand what the variable represents.
    - Try to avoid using names of built-in types or functions, such as str, list, or input.
    - In Python and in the context of PEP 8, a private variable in a class is typically indicated by a single
    leading underscore (example: "_variable"). This is more a convention than a strict rule.

Comments:
    - In-line comments (text after hash symbol #) should be separated by two space from the code
    - It is considered as best practise to put docstrings in your class, method and function.

Additional guidelines not in PEP 8:
    - Try to type your input variables and return variable in function and method as much as possible

You will find below a PEP 8 compliant code

## 2.2 - How to organize your code / your project

Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers a structured way for modeling entities in your project. 
As the framework becomes more complex, the number of classes and files will increase. To ensure readability and 
facilitate swift navigation through your project, it's always good practice to organize your project into several 
folders. Each folder should represent broader functionalities, and all relevant classes or files should be stored 
within them

A typical Python project might have the following directory structure:
    my_project/
    │
    ├── my_package/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── module1.py
    │   └── module2.py
    │
    ├── tests/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── test_module1.py
    │   └── test_module2.py
    │
    ├── docs/
    │   └── ...
    │
    ├── scripts/
    │   └── ...
    │
    ├── setup.py
    ├── README.md
    ├── .gitignore
    └── requirements.txt


Explanation:
    - my_package: This directory contains the actual Python package of your project.
    - tests: This directory contains unit tests for your package.
    - docs: This is where your documentation files reside.
    - scripts: This directory might contain standalone scripts related to your project that don’t belong in the 
      package. (Example of how to use the package should be store there).
    - setup.py: This file allows you to install your project using pip.
    - README.md: A markdown file containing basic information about the project.
    - .gitignore: A file telling Git which files or patterns to ignore. 
    - requirements.txt: A file listing all of the Python packages that your project depends on.

Additional information / TIPS: 
    - You can create multiple directory in your my_package directory if your project has classes or module with a share
    purpose / scope / idea
    - In Python projects, an __init__.py file is utilized within directories to signify to Python that the directory 
    should be treated as a package or a module. If this file is not created, the directory will not be considered as
    a python module and all files in it could be imported. Any code that is written in __init__.py will run when 
    the package is imported. This can be useful for initializing package-level variables or running setup code.
     You can also use __init__.py to facilitate easier imports for the end user.  If you want more information about
     the __init__.py file and python package go to the additional resources directory.

 ## 2.3 - Error Handling
 
**Python Exception Handling**

Exception Handling in Python: try, except, finally

 ** In-Depth Definition/Concept**
In Python, as with any programming language, errors are bound to happen in code.
These could be syntax errors made by programmers, or exceptions that arise during execution.
Exception handling is an essential aspect of programming that determines how a program reacts to unexpected errors
during its execution process. Python provides built-In exceptions that can handle various types of errors ranging from
dividing a number by zero, to calling a non-existent method.

To handle exceptions, Python uses three keywords: try, except, and finally.

- The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors.
- The `except` block lets you handle the error.
- The `finally` block allows you to execute code, regardless of the result of the try and except blocks.

 ** Why use it **
Exception handling is a key aspect of coding in any language including Python.
It's essential for creating robust and fault-tolerant software applications. It offers a way to anticipate problems,
and provides a method of handling errors gracefully without causing crashes.

** When to use it  **
Exception handling should be used whenever there's a chance that an error could occur during the execution of your code.
This can be when you're interacting with files, making network requests, working with collections,
or undertaking many other common tasks.

"""
## 2.4 - if __name__ == "__main__":
    ### Definition/Concept
        In Python, the special built-in variable `__name__` is used to determine if a Python file is being run 
        as the main program or if it is being used as a module in another program. When a Python script is executed,
         `__name__` is set to `"__main__"` if the script is being run as the main program. If the file is being imported 
         as a module into another script, `__name__` is set to the name of the script/module.

    ### Why to Use It
        1. **Code Organization**: It helps in organizing code in a way that it can be both usable as a module and 
        can be run as a standalone script.

        2. **Avoiding Code Execution During Import**: Code under the `__name__ == "__main__"` block won't run when 
        the script is imported as a module, which is useful for preventing code execution when the functions or 
        variables from a script are required elsewhere.

        3. **Testing**: It provides a consistent location to put test code, allowing the file to act as its own 
        test suite.

    ### When to Use It
        1. **Creating Reusable Modules**: If you’re creating a Python script that you want to be usable as a 
        standalone program as well as a module which can be imported and used in other scripts.
        
        2. **Testing Code**: If you want to include test functions in your script that test its internal functionality,
         you might want to run these only when you run the script directly, not when it's imported.
        
        3. **Script Execution Control**: To have control over script execution, i.e., if you want some part of your 
        script to run only when it’s being used as the main program and not during import.

example:

``` ***code in comment to not block the overall script***
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(greet("World"))
```
If you run this script directly, it will print "Hello, World!". If you import this script as a module in another 
script, it won’t print anything but the `greet` function will be available for use.

"""
## 2.5 - List comprehension

**Definition/Concept**
    List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It consists of an expression followed by a `for`
    loop inside square brackets `[]` or '{}. This allows you to generate a new list / dict by applying an expression to 
    each item in an existing list (or other iterable).

    Syntax:     [expression for item in iterable if condition] for creating a list
                {expression which generate a dict for item in iterable if condition} for creating a dict

**Why to use it**
1. **Conciseness:** List comprehensions can make your code more compact and easier to read by reducing the number
                    of lines of code.
2. **Readability:** When used appropriately, list comprehensions can make your intention clear, emphasizing the
                    transformation or filtering of data.
3. **Performance:** In some cases, using list comprehension can be faster than equivalent loops due to internal
                    optimizations in Python.

**When to use it**
1. **Simple Transformations:** When you want to apply a simple transformation to each element in a sequence.
                                For instance, squaring each number in a list or converting each string in a list to
                                uppercase.
2. **Filtering:** When you want to select only certain items from an iterable based on some condition.
                  For example, getting only the even numbers from a list.
3. **Flattening:** When dealing with lists of lists or nested iterables and you want to flatten them.
                    For example, flattening a 2D matrix into a 1D list.

4. **Avoid Overcomplication:** While list comprehensions are powerful, they shouldn't be overused.
                                If the logic becomes too complex, it might be clearer to use traditional loops instead
                                to maintain readability.

It's essential to strike a balance. If a list comprehension becomes hard to read or understand, it might be better
to revert to a more traditional for-loop structure.

"""

"""
## 3.1 - Overall definition
    **Definition/Concept**
        "Dunder" is short for "Double underscore" (__). Dunder methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to 
        enrich your classes in Python. You've already seen these special methods in previous chapters with the
        `__init__` method

    **Why**
        Dunder methods allow you to emulate the behavior of built-in types. For instance, to get the length of a 
        string you can call `len('string')`. But an empty class definition doesn't support this behavior out of the box.

   **When to use it**
        Use dunder methods when you want to define operator behavior on your custom classes or want to mimic built-in 
        Python behavior.

You can find a list of dunder methods in the additional resources directory 
"""


"""
## 3.2 - Use built-in functions for classes by implementing dunder methods

    **Definition/Concept**
        The dunder method for specifying the behavior of built-in Python functions like `len` or `str` involves 
        implementing specific, predefined methods within your class using double underscores (__). 
        Such methods include `__len__`, `__str__`, and others, which Python calls when built-in functions of the same 
        name are used on instances of your class. 

    **Why**
        Implementing these dunder methods enables your custom objects to behave similarly to built-in Python objects, 
        thereby making your classes more intuitive and easy to use for other developers. This can also help your 
        objects to adhere to established Python conventions and idioms. For instance, if you define a `__len__` method,
         developers will know they can use the `len()` function on instances of your class.

    **When to use it**
        Utilize dunder methods when:
        - You want your custom objects to have idiomatic behavior similar to built-in Python types (e.g., allowing the
         use of functions like `len()` and `str()` on your objects).
        - You are creating a class where the logical implementation of such methods makes sense. For example, if your 
        class represents a collection of objects, implementing `__len__` would be intuitive.
        - You want to create objects that can be used interchangeably with built-in types or that can take advantage 
        of Python's rich set of built-in functions.

    **How to implement it**
        - Define methods in your class with names matching the dunder methods, ensuring they accept the correct 
        parameters and return values that adhere to Python’s data model.
        - By defining these methods, you allow instances of your class to be used with `len(instance)` and `
        str(instance)`, providing behavior similar to built-in Python objects.
        - Always refer to the Python data model documentation to understand the expected behavior and return values 
        of these methods to ensure compatibility and idiomatic usage.

By adhering to this approach, you ensure that your custom classes are not only user-friendly but also adhere to the 
principles and conventions that Python developers expect.
"""

"""
Example of dunder method : __len__
    __len__(self) determines the “length” of your object, which allows you to use the len(obj) syntax.

    type 'InstrumentList' has no len()

"""
## 3.2.1 -The __str__() method
    **Definition/Concept**:
        The `__str__()` method in Python is another "dunder" method associated with a class. It is meant to return a 
        string representation of an object which is intended to be informative and easily readable for end-users.

    **Why**:
        - To offer a "user-friendly" string representation of an object that can be used in various contexts like
         printing the object.
        - It is beneficial when you want a simple description of the object rather than an exhaustive or technical one, 
          as given by `__repr__()`.
        - The primary goal of the `__str__()` method is readability over unambiguity. 

    **When to use it**:
        - When you want to provide an intuitive and user-friendly string representation of an object for display 
        purposes, especially in user-facing applications.
        - When you are implementing print statements or logs where the technical details of an object 
        are not necessary.
        - When you call the built-in `str()` function on an object or use format string methods, the `__str__()` 
        method gets invoked. So, it's helpful to define it when you anticipate such use-cases for your custom objects.

"""
## 3.2.2 - The __repr__() Method
    **Definition/Concept**:
        The `__repr__()` method in Python is a dunder method associated with a class.  
        It should return a string that looks like a valid Python expression and could be used to recreate an object with 
        the same properties.  Ideally, using `eval(repr(obj))` should produce an object equivalent to `obj`.
        
    **Why**:
        - To provide an "official" string representation of an object that is useful for debugging and development. 
        - The output of `__repr__()` is intended to be unambiguous and helps developers understand the properties of 
        the object.
        - While both `__str__()` and `__repr__()` methods in a class provide string representations, the former is for 
        end-users and should be readable, while the latter is primarily for developers and debugging.
        
    **When to use it**:
        - When you want to provide a detailed and unambiguous string representation of an object for debugging and
         logging.
        - When you want to ensure that there's a clear way to recreate the object from its string representation.
        
    Benefits of __repr__() when implementing complex Python framework:
        Traceability: In complex financial simulations or optimizations, you might be dealing with hundreds of 
                    instrument objects. If something goes wrong, having a clear __repr__() output can help you trace 
                    back to the exact instrument causing the issue.
    
        Reproducibility: Sometimes you may need to send the state of your system (the exact instruments and their 
                    properties) to someone else for verification, testing, or audit purposes. With a clear __repr__() 
                    method, you can recreate the exact state of objects with ease.
    
        Logging: When logging system activities, having a clear representation of the objects being processed can be 
                useful for future reference or debugging.

## 3.3 - Operator overloading
    
    Built-in operator does not work on custom classes. For example, if we try to use "+" or any other operator such as
    "-", "*", "/", ">", ... this will raise a TypeError as the behavior for these operators are not implemented for the
    object. If we want to use built-in operator for custom objects we need to use dunder methods.
    The only exception is the "=" operator. If we don't implement the dunder method to specify the behavior of the
    equal operator for custom objects, python will check for object identity (i.e., both objects are the
    same instance). Thus even though each attributes of 2 objects are equal the "=" will return false
    
    Implementing dunder methods referring to built-in operator is called operator overloading. 
    **Definition/Concept**: 
        It is the ability of one operation, such as addition or multiplication, to behave in one way or more 
        according to the data or objects being operated upon.
    
    **Why**: 
        Operator overloading is used to make programming more intuitive and the code more user friendly,
        behaving like they would with built-in types.
    
    **_When to use `Operator Overloading`_**: 
        Operator overloading is used when you want to specify more than one meaning to an operator or apply specific 
        operation
        
    You will find below example of operator overloading.

"""
Example of operator overloading for "+" and "-" operator
Here the operator overloading is realized by implementing the following method : __add__ and __sub__

When we try to add up an object to a BankAccount type object with the "+" operator the __add__ method is called. 
The method checks if the object we try to add up to the first element of the addition is a BankAccount instance. If it's
the case it modify the current balance of the first element and return the updated amount. If it's not the case, 
it will not perform any operation. 

When implementing dunder method for operator overloading, we can specify multiply behavior which will depend on the 
type of the object. If we look at the __sub__ method, the object we try to subtract the first element with could be a 
BankAccount instance or a FinancialInstrument with the same currency than the bank account. If it's the case it modify 
the current balance of the first element and return the updated amount. If it's not the case, it will not perform any

           - Called when trying to assign a value to an instance attribute.
        - `__delattr__(self, name)`: 
           - Called when an attribute is deleted.

    Item Access and Assignment (for collections, e.g., lists, dictionaries):
        - `__getitem__(self, key)`: 
           - Called to retrieve the value associated with the provided key.
        - `__setitem__(self, key, value)`: 
           - Called to set the value for the provided key.
        - `__delitem__(self, key)`: 
           - Called to delete the value associated with the provided key.

Usage Contexts:
    - **Object Life Cycle Methods**: Enable control during object instantiation and destruction.
    - **Attribute Access Methods**: Allow defining behaviors for attribute access, setting, and deletion.
    - **Item Access Methods**: Provide a way to customize how items in a collection are accessed, set, and deleted.
    - **Descriptor Methods**: Enable creating objects that can manage the attributes of other objects.

Use Cases:
    - **Enhance Usability and Readability**: Provide a Pythonic interface to your classes (e.g., enabling iteration, 
    context management).
    - **Resource Management**: E.g., using `__del__` to release resources or `__setattr__` to update related object 
    states.
    - **Custom Containers**: Utilize `__getitem__` and related methods to create custom collection classes.
    - **Data Wrangling and Validation**: Using `__set__` or `__setattr__` to enforce types or constraints on attribute 
    values.

## 4.1 - Decorators
** Definition/Concept
        In Python, a decorator is a tagged that we put where a method is implemented that allows us to modify the 
        behavior of a function or class method without permanently modifying it. Decorators wrap a function, 
        augmenting or changing its behavior.
        In a nutshell, a decorator allow us to perform operation before or after the execution of a function.
        To applied a decorator to a function you will need to put an @ with the name of the decorator before the 
        implementation of the desired function (see example below)
    
    ### Why
        Decorators provide a way to extend a function's behavior without changing its source code. 
        This means you can reuse the same function in different contexts with different behaviors.
        
    ### When to use it
        Decorators are used when you want to wrap a function with additional functionality. 
        For example, you can use decorators to track execution time or check if a user is logged in before running 
        the function.
"""

"""
Example: how to implement and use a decorator
to implement a function based operator, you need to create a function which take a function as input and implement a
wrapper function in it. 
"""

def simple_decorator(func):  # here we defined a decorator
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function execution")
        func()
        print("After function execution")

    return wrapper


@simple_decorator  # here we applied the decorator to the function say_hello()
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, OOP course")

say_hello()

"""
** Decorators
Python provides several built-in decorators and others in its standard library. 
The most common are @staticmethod, @dataclass, @property, @classmethod
We already saw the first two one. Let's take a look at the other ones.

    @staticmethod
    The @staticmethod decorator is used for methods that don’t need access to the class or instance.
    
    @dataclass
    The @dataclass decorator, introduced in Python 3.7, automatically generates special methods like init(), repr(), 
    and eq() for a class

    @property
    The @property decorator is used to define methods in a class that act like attributes.
    
    @classmethod
    The @classmethod decorator is used to define methods that operate on the class rather than instances.
"""

"""
** @property Decorator

    ### Definition/Concept
        @property is a built-in Python decorator that allows you to define a method in a class that can be accessed 
        like an attribute. It is often used to control access to private attributes or to add computed properties. 
        This means you can retrieve the result of a method by accessing it like a simple attribute, rather than calling 
        it with parentheses.
    
    ### Why to use it
        Using @property allows you to create methods that can be accessed like attributes, which makes code cleaner and 
        more intuitive for users of the class. It provides a way to encapsulate and protect data, and to define computed
         attributes without changing the interface of your class.

    ### When to use it
        You should use @property when you want to expose a method as a readable attribute while still maintaining the 
        flexibility to change its underlying logic or behavior later without breaking existing code. It is useful when 
        you need to perform computations or transformations on an attribute before returning it, but don't want the user
         to be aware of the logic involved.

class Position:
    def __init__(self, asset: FinancialAsset, initial_investment: float, current_value: float):
        self.asset = asset
        self.average_entry_price = initial_investment
        self.market_value = current_value

    @property
    def pnl(self):
        return self.market_value - self.average_entry_price


last_date, last_close = datetime.now(), 175.0
equity_last_quote = Quote(last_date, last_close)
equity = FinancialAsset('AAPL', equity_last_quote, 'USD')

position = Position(equity, 1000, 1250)
print(position.pnl)

"""
** @classmethod decorator
    ** Definition/Concept
        @classmethod is a decorator used to define a method that belongs to the class itself, not to an instance of 
        the class. The first argument to a class method is cls, which refers to the class (not an instance). 
        This allows class methods to modify the class state, create new instances, or access class-level attributes.

    ** Why to use it
        Class methods allow you to work with class-level data and behaviors. They are useful when you want a method 
        that logically operates on the class itself, rather than on instances of the class. You can use them to modify 
        class-level state or to provide factory methods that create instances in a certain way.

    ** When to use it
        Use a class method when:
            You need to work with class-level attributes or behaviors.
            You need to create factory methods that return instances of the class, but you want the method to remain 
            flexible and applicable to subclasses.
            You want to provide alternative constructors or handle logic related to the entire class rather than 
            individual instances.
"""

class Date:
    def __init__(self, year, month, day):
        self.year = year
        self.month = month
        self.day = day

    @classmethod
    def from_string(cls, date_string):
        year, month, day = map(int, date_string.split('-'))
        return cls(year, month, day)

date = Date.from_string("2024-07-29")
print(date.year)  # Output: 2024


"""
## Class-based Decorator
    ** **Definition/Concept** 
    Class-based decorators leverage the power of objects to hold state or utilize inheritance for related decorator 
    logic. Essentially, a class-based decorator is a class that implements the __call__ method and the wrapper function. 
    When the instance of the class is called, the __call__ method is executed. The instance of the class is called
    before the method or function annotated by the decorator. 

    ** Why to use it** 
     - State Management: One of the biggest advantages of class-based decorators over function-based ones is the ability
                        to retain state. Since classes can have instance variables, it's easy to store and manage state
                        between calls.
                        
    - Reusability and Composition: Class-based decorators can utilize inheritance to create a family of related 
                                   decorators, or even compose multiple decorators together.
                                   
    - Enhanced Control: By defining other methods apart from __call__, you can provide more controlled or varied 
                        behavior, enhancing flexibility.

** When to use it  ** 
    - Stateful Decorations: When the decorator needs to remember something between calls, such as counting the number of 
                            times a function has been called or caching its results.
    - Configurable Decorations: If you need to pass arguments to your decorator to configure its behavior. 
                                Though function-based decorators can also achieve this, class-based decorators can 
                                sometimes make this more intuitive, especially when there are many parameters or complex 
                                configurations.
    - Multiple Related Decorators: If you are designing a suite of related decorators, it might be beneficial to 
                                encapsulate their shared logic within a base class and derive from it.
"""

"""
Example: Class based decorator applied to trade logging execution
An `Order` object is instantiated with details about a trade and stored in the `order` variable.
Then TradeExecutionService.execute_trade(order)` is called:
    1. Internally, `TradeLogger` is called first (due to the decorator). It wraps the original `execute_trade` 
    function with additional functionality (logging).
    2. The wrapped function executes the original `execute_trade` function, retrieves the trade details, logs them, 
    and then returns the trade details.

In-depth code explanation for `TradeLogger`
    - `__init__(self, log_file='trade_log.txt')`:
        - Initializes the logger with a file path (`log_file`), where trade execution details will be logged.
        - `log_file` defaults to 'trade_log.txt' if no argument is provided.
    
    - `__call__(self, execute_trade_func)`:
        - Allows the class instance to be called as a function.
        - Accepts `execute_trade_func` which should be a function executing a trade.
        - Returns a `wrapper` function that enhances `execute_trade_func` with logging functionality.
    
    - `wrapper` Function (Nested inside `__call__`):
        - Takes any positional (`*args`) and keyword (`**kwargs`) arguments.
        - Executes the trade function `execute_trade_func` and stores the result in `trade_result`.
        - Logs the trade details to a file (specified by `self.log_file`):
            - Appends the date, a descriptive message, and `trade_result` to the log file.

## 4.4 - dataclass
    **Definition/Concept:**
        `dataclass` is a decorator, introduced in Python 3.7 as part of the `dataclasses` module. 
        It provides a way to automatically generate special methods for classes, such as `__init__()`, `__repr__()`, 
        and `__eq__()`, based on the class's annotated fields. The primary aim is to reduce the boilerplate code 
        required for creating classes, especially ones that are primarily used to carry data.

    **Why to use it:**
    1. **Reduce Boilerplate**: Writing classes that primarily store data often requires repetitive code for basic 
                               operations (e.g., initializing, representation, comparison). `dataclass` reduces the 
                                need for such boilerplate.
                                
    2. **Improve Readability**: By using `dataclass`, the intent of the class becomes clearer. It indicates that the 
                                class is primarily used for data storage.
    
    3. **Flexibility**: While the automatic generation of methods is its key feature, `dataclass` also offers a range 
                        of parameters, such as `order` (for ordering operations like less than or greater than), 
                        `frozen` (to make the instance immutable), and `default` (to set default values).
    
    4. **Type Annotations**: It encourages the use of type annotations, making code more self-documenting and 
                             potentially catching type-related errors earlier.
    
    **When to use it:**
    1. **Data Holders**: When you're defining classes that primarily act as data containers or simple data structures. 
                        
    2. **Avoid Repetition**: If you find yourself repeatedly writing the same methods (`__init__`, `__repr__`, etc.) 
                            for different classes.
                            
    3. **Immutable Data Structures**: By setting the `frozen` parameter to `True`, you can easily create immutable 
                                      data structures.
                                      
    5. **Caution**: Avoid using `dataclass` for classes with complex logic, behavior, or those that don't fit 
                    the "data container" mold. In such cases, it's better to manually implement required methods to 
                    ensure control over the class's behavior.

"""
Example of a dataclass: Quote

### 4.5 - utility class

     ** Definition/Concept**
        A utility class is a design pattern in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where the class groups together a set 
        of methods that perform common, often standalone, functions without maintaining state. These classes are 
        typically static in nature and are not instantiated. Instead, they serve as a collection of methods that can be
         called without creating an object of the class.
        
    ** Why to use Utility it**
        -Organization and Cohesion: By grouping related methods together, you make the codebase cleaner and more 
        intuitive. Related functionalities are located together, so developers know where to look.
    
        -Code Reusability: Once a method is defined in a utility class, it can be used anywhere in the application 
        without instantiation, reducing redundancy.
    
        - Statelessness: Utility classes typically don't maintain state, reducing the potential for bugs related to 
        mutable shared state.
    
    ** When to use Utility Classes **
        - Common Calculations: As with the example above, if there are calculations that are used frequently in 
        different parts of the application, they can be grouped in a utility class.
        - Data Validations: Validating data formats, ensuring data adheres to certain standards, or checking 
        constraints.
    
        -Conversions: Any kind of conversion, be it currency, data format, units, etc., can be incorporated within a 
        utility class for easy access and clarity.
    
        -Constants: If there are constants specific to your project that need to be used across different parts of 
         an application, they can be housed in a utility class.
    
    However, one should be cautious not to overuse utility classes. If you find that a utility class is growing too 
    large or incorporating too many unrelated methods, it might be a sign that the responsibilities should be refactored
    or divided among more specialized classes. Utility classes should remain cohesive, with each method serving a related 
    utility function.

## 4.6 - Factory

    ## Definition/Concept
        Factory Pattern in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to a creational design pattern that provides an 
        interface for creating objects. Instead of calling a class constructor directly to create an object, a factory 
        method is used to create the object. This method is typically defined in an interface, which is implemented 
        by concrete classes.

    ### 2. Why to use it
        Here are some reasons to use the Factory Pattern:
        - **Decoupling**: The Factory Pattern promotes the decoupling of the code that uses objects from the code that 
                        creates them, which can simplify code changes and maintenance.
        - **Handling Complexity**: When object creation is complex or involves multiple steps, constructors might 
                        become overly complex. A factory can encapsulate this complexity and provide a simple API to 
                        the client.
        - **Code Reusability**: Factories can be reused across the application, which often leads to less code 
                        duplication.

    ### 3. When to use it
    The Factory Pattern is particularly beneficial in the following scenarios:

    - **Dynamic Implementation**: When the exact type of the object to be created needs to be determined at runtime 
                                based on some conditions, a factory can decide which subclass to instantiate.
    
    - **Complex Object Creation**: When the object creation process is complex and involves multiple steps,     
                                   it's logical to encapsulate this complexity in a factory rather than complicating the 
                                   client code with it.
    
    - **Family of Related Objects**: If you have a family of related objects that you need to instantiate, 
                                     it might be useful to use a factory to manage these creations, especially if they 
                                     have similar instantiation logic or configurations.
    
    - **Enhanced Control Over Object Creation**: If you need more control over object creation, for example implementing 
                                                 a singleton pattern, object pooling, or caching, a factory can provide 
                                                 this centralized control.

==> Use Factory when you're unsure about the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with, 
    or when you want to delegate the responsibility of deciding which class to instantiate.
"""

""" 
Example
The Stock class requires a ticker symbol and price. It has a method get_market_value that returns a string indicating 
its market value per share.
The Bond class needs an issuer and face value. It has a method get_face_value that returns a string indicating its 
face value.
The FinancialInstrumentFactory class creates either a Stock or a Bond instance depending on the instrument_type 
parameter. The **kwargs argument allows us to pass the keyword arguments needed to instantiate the desired 
financial instrument.

This pattern enables you to manage the creation of various financial instrument objects systematically, even when the 
precise types of financial instruments are not known until runtime. The factory method can be extended to handle 
additional financial instrument types as needed, enhancing modularity and scalability in the software design.

## 4.7 - custom exception
    ** Definition/Concept** 
        Python by default provides several built-in exceptions such as `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `IndexError` etc.
        However, there might be cases where we would want to purposefully raise an exception. This is where custom 
        exceptions come into play. A custom exception class can be created by inheriting from the base class 
        `Exception`, or any other built-in exception class.

    ** Why to use Custom Exceptions** 
        - **Understandability**: By creating our own exceptions, we give clear names to them which can easily be 
                                understood by someone else reading the code. Instead of using common built-in exceptions 
                                everywhere, having a specific exception type give more human-readable and self-explained 
                                exceptions. 
        - **Control flow**: Custom exception allows us to control the flow of our program explicitly. 
                            We can choose when and where to raise these exceptions.
        - **Modularity**: A single custom exception class can be used across multiple modules in an application.

 ** When to use Custom Exceptions  ** 
    Custom exceptions are especially helpful when we want to handle certain situations differently based on the type 
    of error in our code. For every unique situation, we can create a new exception class and then catch it in our code. 
    When we are building a large Python application, it's a good practice to define our own exception class.

The primary goal is often just to provide a unique type that can be caught and handled separately from other types of 
exceptions. When creating a custom exception class, it's not always necessary to add additional methods or attributes 
to the class. If no extra functionality is needed, and the sole purpose is to provide a distinct exception type, 
then the body of the class can be left empty.

## 4.7 Descriptors : Descriptors provide a way to customize attribute access in Python classes. 
    A descriptor is a special type of object in Python that customizes the behavior of attribute access (getting, 
    setting, and deleting). To implement a descriptor, you define a class that implements any of these methods:

        __get__(self, obj, objtype): Called when you retrieve the attribute (i.e., when you access instrument.volatility).

        __set__(self, obj, value): Called when you assign a value to the attribute (i.e., financialasset.price = value).

        __delete__(self, obj): (optional) Called when you delete the attribute.
        Descriptors are especially useful when you want to add validation, logging, or specific behavior during 
        attribute access or modification, which is what we're doing in this example with volatility.

print(processor.data)  # Prints the content without "Loading data..."

"""
Let’s break down how this works step by step:
When @LazyProperty is applied to the data method in DataProcessor:
    An instance of LazyProperty is created, with the data method as its function attribute.
    This LazyProperty instance replaces the data method in the class dictionary.

When we create a DataProcessor instance:
    No data is loaded yet. The filename is stored, but data is not accessed.

The first time processor.data is accessed:
    In Python, attributes (including properties) can be accessed without parentheses if they are not methods 
    (i.e., they don't require arguments). In this example, data is a property. If a method does not have arguments
    it's a property. 
    Python sees that data is a descriptor (it has a __get__ method) and calls LazyProperty.__get__(processor, DataProcessor).
    Inside __get__:
        It checks if obj (processor) is None. It’s not, so it continues.
        It calls self.function(obj), which is equivalent to calling the original data method.
        This prints “Loading data…” and reads the file.
        The result is stored back into the processor instance using setattr(obj, self.name, value).
        The value is returned.

The second time processor.data is accessed:
    Python first looks for an instance attribute named data.
    It finds one (because we set it in step 3d), so it returns that value directly.
    The LazyProperty.__get__ method is not called this time.

The key point is that after the first access, the LazyProperty descriptor is effectively replaced by the computed value.
This is why the “Loading data…” message only appears once.

## 4.8 - singleton
    ** Definition/Concept** 
        The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts a class to instantiate multiple objects. 
        It's a way to ensure a class has only one, unique instance, and to provide a global point of access to it.
        
    ** Why to use it** 
        Singleton pattern is employed when we need to control object creation, ensuring that there's only one object 
        of its kind throughout the application, for example, a single database connection shared by multiple objects as 
        opening a database connection is a costly process.
        
    ** When to use it ** 
        Utilize the Singleton pattern when a particular class in your program should be available to all clients and 
        shared among all, like a single configuration object.

In Python, we can create Singleton using the `__new__` method.

## 4.10 - unit test
     ** Definition/Concept** 
        Unit testing is a method of software testing that checks whether individual components of the source code work
         as expected. In Python, `unittest` is a built-in module for testing units of code.
        
     ** Why to use it** 
        The `unittest` module provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests, helping you ensure your 
        code behaves as expected, which is crucial for building reliable applications.
        
    **  When to use it ** 
        Use `unittest` whenever you write new code and want to verify its behavior or when you refactor or modify 
        the existing code to ensure its behavior hasn't changed unexpectedly.
        When you launch a unit test, a test session will start. For each unit test the result will be 'Passed' 
        if the unit test has the expected behavior. If not the result will be 'Failed'. 
        Typically, we try to regroup all the unit test in one directory or one script. If you are implementing a 
        complex or large project you might want to use several script to do you unit test, each script checking one
        part of your project. If you want to run all the unit test of your script you can use the following code : 
        'unittest.main()'. If you plan to doing so, your script should implement the 'if __name__ == "__main__":'
        logic. Unit test should always be implemented in a seperate script
