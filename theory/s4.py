## Decorators
    ** Definition/Concept
        In Python, a decorator is a tagged that we put where a method is implemented that allows us to modify the 
        behavior of a function or class method without permanently modifying it. Decorators wrap a function, 
        augmenting or changing its behavior.
        In a nutshell, a decorator allow us to perform operation before or after the execution of a function.
        To applied a decorator to a function you will need to put an @ with the name of the decorator before the 
        implementation of the desired function (see example below)
    
    ### Why
        Decorators provide a way to extend a function's behavior without changing its source code. 
        This means you can reuse the same function in different contexts with different behaviors.
        
    ### When to use it
        Decorators are used when you want to wrap a function with additional functionality. 
        For example, you can use decorators to track execution time or check if a user is logged in before running 
        the function.
"""

"""
Example: how to implement and use a decorator
to implement a function based operator, you need to create a function which take a function as input and implement a
wrapper function in it.

    return wrapper


@simple_decorator  # here we applied the decorator to the function say_hello()
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, OOP course")

say_hello()

"""
** Decorators
Python provides several built-in decorators and others in its standard library. 
The most common are @staticmethod, @dataclass, @property, @classmethod
We already saw the first two one. Let's take a look at the other ones.

    @staticmethod
    The @staticmethod decorator is used for methods that donâ€™t need access to the class or instance.
    
    @dataclass
    The @dataclass decorator, introduced in Python 3.7, automatically generates special methods like init(), repr(), 
    and eq() for a class

    @property
    The @property decorator is used to define methods in a class that act like attributes.
    
    @classmethod
    The @classmethod decorator is used to define methods that operate on the class rather than instances.

"""
## Class-based Decorator
    ** Definition/Concept** 
    Class-based decorators use the functionality of objects to hold state or utilize inheritance for related decorator 
    logic. Essentially, a class-based decorator is a class that implements the __call__ method and the wrapper function. 
    When the instance of the class is called, the __call__ method is executed. The instance of the class is called
    before the method or function annotated by the decorator. 

    ** Why to use it** 
     - State Management: One of the biggest advantages of class-based decorators over function-based ones is the ability
                        to retain state. Since classes can have instance variables, it's easy to store and manage state
                        between calls.
                        
    - Reusability and Composition: Class-based decorators can utilize inheritance to create a family of related 
                                   decorators, or even compose multiple decorators together.
                                   
    - Enhanced Control: By defining other methods apart from __call__, you can provide more controlled or varied 
                        behavior, enhancing flexibility.

    ** When to use it  ** 
    - Stateful Decorations: When the decorator needs to remember something between calls, such as counting the number of 
                            times a function has been called or caching its results.
                            
    - Configurable Decorations: If you need to pass arguments to your decorator to configure its behavior. 
                                Though function-based decorators can also achieve this, class-based decorators can 
                                sometimes make this more intuitive, especially when there are many parameters or complex 
                                configurations.
                                
    - Multiple Related Decorators: If you are designing a suite of related decorators, it might be beneficial to 
                                encapsulate their shared logic within a base class and derive from it.
